## 🏛️ History

This browser extension was made with the motive of **accelerating the speed of exam taking** in Platzi inspired by the way in which Typeform structures the shortcuts of its forms.

Keys were extended to not just letters (A, B, C...), but numbers (1, 2, 3). Then the whiteboard functionality was added for **drawing within the exam**, I called it **Greenboard**.

Finally two additional web themes to touch up the appearance of the exam.

**Zen Mode** is the name that many applications use for the _concentration_ mode that **reduces visual elements in the graphical interface**. We use it here as Zen Mode as well.

**SSH Mode** is a theme **inspired by the default terminal design**. A design similar to the command line interface of installing packages with Python, or initializing a project with ESLint.

## 🔩 Installation

Follow this tutorial for installation.

It works correctly in Google Chrome and Micorosft Edge.

At this time it can only be installed through the developer mode of the Google Chrome browser. It is being reviewed so that it can be available in the Chrome Web Store.
